# Linked List Implementation

This is a simple implementation of a linked list in [Your Programming Language]. The linked list is a fundamental data structure that consists of nodes connected together, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

## Features

- **Singly Linked List:** Nodes are connected in a forward sequence.
- **Doubly Linked List (Optional):** Nodes are connected both forward and backward.

## Getting Started

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash

   ```

3. [Additional steps if necessary, e.g., compiling, setting up dependencies]
